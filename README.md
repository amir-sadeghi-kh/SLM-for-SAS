# SLM for SAS

Welcome to the SLM-for-SAS repository! This project aims to train a small language model (SLM) to learn and understand the SAS programming language. Given the current limitations in language models for SAS, 
this repository provides the tools and code necessary to fine-tune an existing language model specifically for SAS.

TODO: explain the line above "limitations in language models" say the results are not okay. need fine tune

## Introduction

The SLM-for-SAS project addresses the need for a specialized language model capable of understanding and generating SAS code. 
Current language models show suboptimal performance when dealing with SAS, which is why we aim to fine-tune a pre-existing model to better cater to SAS language constructs and syntax.

## Goals

- Fine-tune a SLM to improve its understanding of the SAS programming language.
- Provide an end-to-end pipeline for training and evaluating the language model.
- Improve the model's performance in understanding, generating, and predicting SAS code.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SAS-Model-Trainer.git
cd SAS-Model-Trainer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
